# simon-game

Simple Simon game built using HTML/CSS/jQuery.  Based on Udemy Complete 2019 Web Developer course project, this game has a loop added to repeat the complete game pattern at the beginning of each round, with accurate color and sounds (this more accurately reflects the real Simon game).  The original project only displays the latest additional click in the pattern, indicating the last button that needs to be pushed in the pattern.
